Response\n\nFirst of all: wow.You’re shouldering a massive campaign with a lot of moving parts, and you're doing it while also producing and posting content almost daily.The fact that you're this deep into the strategy while also executing day-to-day social marketing?That’s rare—and exhausting.The overwhelm is real, and it's valid.It’s clear that you’re sitting on a powder keg of opportunity.But without structure, even the most promising ideas can scatter instead of spark.Right now, your job as “acting CMO” is less about generating *more* ideas and more about **orchestrating the right sequence**.Let’s gently challenge one of your impulses: It’s tempting to “do it all.”But if you try to run every campaign, drop every name, and target every audience all at once, you'll dilute the power of the message.Instead, ask yourself:\n\n- **What is the core emotional thread of this campaign?** (Nostalgia?Anti-corporate rebellion?Reclaiming the internet?)- **What are the phases of attention you want to cultivate?** (Tease → Reveal → Rally → Launch → Sustain.)- **What communities do you want to ignite *first*—and who leads them?**\n\nIf you focus on sequencing, everything changes.You don’t need to build an audience from scratch—you need to **activate the right people in the right order**, and tell a story that makes them feel part of a movement, not just a product launch.---\n## Relevant Author Quotes\n\n**Casper ter Kuile, _The Power of Ritual_:**  \n*\"We’re not just hungry for meaning.We’re hungry for belonging.\"*  \n→ Your nostalgia campaign works because

Go-To-Market Ground Zero: Feeling the Weight, Building the Fire\n\nOkay, this is real.I'm in the thick of it.I’m essentially acting as the CMO for the relaunch of **Digg** (dig.com), and while I’m surrounded by incredible assets—Digg Nation's 30K viewers, a Twitter following of 1.2 million, a killer nostalgia hook, and big-name board members—I’m also spinning in the overwhelm.I’ve got content going out daily, an all-star PR team, and a deeply loyal early audience.But that’s not enough.Right now, the primary marketing engine is the podcast, **Digg Nation**—but the connection between it and the Digg brand is still abstract.It’s running, it’s got traction, but it hasn’t fused with the product narrative yet because the product hasn’t launched.Once we launch, the show and the site will be tethered.That’s when we start threading our stories.We’re running a nostalgia campaign—featuring legends like the crew from Tiki Bar TV—and it’s working.It's waking up the old guard.But nostalgia can only be the spark, not the fuel.I need more than eyes—I need **engaged believers**.I need a community that goes beyond retro feelings and actually *wants what we’re building*.We’ve got huge chess pieces to play with.Alexis Ohanian.Kevin Rose.Christian Selig (Apollo dev).Jamie from WallStreetBets.These are not minor players—they're *storylines*.But I need to structure the narrative arcs so they build into launch and extend beyond.June 4 is launch day.And it’s coming fast.I need a go-to-market *campaign*, not a scattershot of good ideas.I need a **content calendar** that weaves together our strengths.And I need to **plan for post-launch community building**, especially for when we roll out open taxonomy (sub-digs).That’s when Jamie’s community drops, and the \"new Reddit\" becomes more than a tagline—it becomes infrastructure.So, here's my question to myself:\n\n**What story are we telling from now until June 4—and who needs to hear it first?**\n---\n## Therapist & Life Coach Response\n\nFirst of all: wow.You’re shouldering a massive campaign with a lot of moving parts, and you're doing it while also producing and posting content almost daily.The fact that you're this deep into the strategy while also executing day-to-day social marketing?That’s rare—and exhausting.The overwhelm is real, and it's valid.It’s clear that you’re sitting on a powder keg of opportunity.But without structure, even the most promising ideas can scatter instead of spark.Right now, your job as “acting CMO” is less about generating *more* ideas and more about **orchestrating the right sequence**.Let’s gently challenge one of your impulses: It’s tempting to “do it all.”But if you try to run every campaign, drop every name, and target every audience all at once, you'll dilute the power of the message.Instead, ask yourself:\n\n- **What is the core emotional thread of this campaign?** (Nostalgia?Anti-corporate rebellion?Reclaiming the internet?)- **What are the phases of attention you want to cultivate?** (Tease → Reveal → Rally → Launch → Sustain.)- **What communities do you want to ignite *first*—and who leads them?**\n\nIf you focus on sequencing, everything changes.You don’t need to build an audience from scratch—you need to **activate the right people in the right order**, and tell a story that makes them feel part of a movement, not just a product launch.---\n## Relevant Author Quotes\n\n**Casper ter Kuile, _The Power of Ritual_:**  \n*\"We’re not just hungry for meaning.We’re hungry for belonging.\"*  \n→ Your nostalgia campaign works because
